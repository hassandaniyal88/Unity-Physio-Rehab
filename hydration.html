      <h1>Hydration & Joint Health</h1>
      <p>Did you know your cartilage is nearly 80% water? That means hydration plays a major role in your joint health and movement.</p>

      <p>Water keeps the cartilage in your joints soft and smooth, reducing friction during movement. Proper hydration helps cushion your joints, absorb shocks, and reduce inflammation.</p>

      <p>When you're dehydrated, your joints can become stiff and painful, making movement harder and increasing the risk of injury. Especially for athletes and those recovering from injury or surgery, maintaining hydration is critical.</p>

      <p><strong>Our tip:</strong> Make water your best friend! Carry a bottle, set reminders, and stay hydrated throughout the day to support your joint function and overall health.</p>

      <p>At Unity Physio Rehab, we not only help with treatment â€” we educate you on lifestyle factors like hydration that directly affect your recovery and wellness journey.</p>
